## Overview
This project was designed to analyize Citi Bike data.

## Results
As we review the data we can see most riders are male, at almost 110k. We can also see a ride surge around 8am and 5pm. This can be associated with the daily work scheduale of most people.

## Summary
We can see using the visuals plenty of clear data. The tableau allows us to create simple easy to read diagrams.
